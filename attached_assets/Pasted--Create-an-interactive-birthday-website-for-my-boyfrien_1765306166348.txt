Create an interactive birthday website for my boyfriend with a love letter / envelope theme.
The website should open with a cute envelope or folded letter animation in the center of the screen. The user should click the envelope to open it, revealing the content inside like a handwritten love letter.
Design & Vibes:
* Soft pastel color palette: blush pink, cream, baby blue
* Warm, cozy, handwritten love letter aesthetic
* Gentle animations:
    * envelope opening
    * floating hearts
    * twinkling stars
    * smooth fade-in text as the letter unfolds
* Feels intimate, romantic, Gen Z coded, and not overly formal
Structure & Content:
1. Hero Section (inside the opened letter)
    * Title text: “Someone I Love Was Born Today ✨”
    * Subtle, sweet entrance animation
2. Romantic Message
    * Short paragraph in Gen Z-style romantic English
    * Poetic, warm, and genuine (not cringe, not too dramatic)
    * Sounds like a heartfelt love letter written at night
3. “Reasons I Love You” Section
    * Cute cards or bullet points inside the letter
    * Playful, sweet reasons (small moments, habits, inside jokes)
4. Interactive Birthday Surprise Button
    * Button text: “Click for a Birthday Surprise 🎉”
    * On click:
        * show a hidden love note
        * a 1 yes-day coupon
        * trigger floating emoji/hearts explosion
        * optional soft animation
5. Birthday Countdown or Make a Wish Moment
    * Simple countdown timer to his birthday (his bday on dec 25 and i will give the web to him on dec 24 11.30 am)
    *  a “close your eyes and make a wish ✨” interaction
6. Final Message Section
    * Title: “To the Man Who Stole My Heart”
    * A heartfelt birthday message as the closing of the letter
Technical Requirements:
* Use simple HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript
* PC-friendly and responsive
* Clean, beginner-friendly code (easy to edit text and colors)
* Use vintage aesthetic-style font(s) and soft gradients
* Include small cute emoji details (💌 ✨ 💗 🌷)
Optional Cute Add-ons (if possible):
* A mini love quiz about us (multiple choice, playful results)
* A fake popup that says: “Error: too much love 💗”
* A background music toggle (lany’s song, optional autoplay OFF)
The final result should feel like opening a personal digital love letter made just for him — romantic, playful, emotional, and memorable.

Please focus more on emotional flow and interaction and heavy  visuals.
